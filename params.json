{"name":"Chrome Dev Tools Setup","tagline":"This repository contains the information on how to setup the dev tools in Chrome.","body":"# Step 1 - Download sources of example as zip file\r\n\r\n[FixtureFinder](https://github.com/EmbeddedTestingWorkshop/ATD_FixtureFinder) \r\n\r\nClick on \"Download ZIP\"\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with git you can of course clone the repo as well.\r\n\r\n﻿﻿![Step 1](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_1.png)\r\n\r\n# Step 2 - Extract the zip file to a local folder \r\n\r\nExtract the zip file\r\n\r\n# Step 3 - Open FixtureFinder.html in Chrome\r\n\r\nOpen the file Embedded_FixtureFinder-master/src/html/FixtureFinder.html in Chrome\r\n\r\n![Step 3](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_3.png)\r\n\r\n# Step 4 - Open Chrome Dev Tools \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways to open Chrome Dev Tools:\r\n* View -> Developer -> Developer Tools\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts:  \r\n  \r\n    Mac: Cmd + Opt (alt) + I  \r\n\r\n    Windows: F12, Ctrl + Shift+ I  \r\n\r\n* Right click on an element on the page and select \"Inspect Element\"\r\n\r\n![Step 4](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_4.png)\r\n\r\n# Step 5 - Go to Sources Panel\r\n\r\n![Step 5](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_5.png)\r\n\r\n# Step 6 - Add locally stored files as a folder to the workspace\r\n\r\n* Right click in the white area below code.jquery.com, file:// and maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com\r\n* Select \"Add folder to workspace\" and select the folder where you extracted the download\r\n\r\n![Step 6](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_6.png)\r\n\r\n# Step 7 - Allow Chrome to access the local folder\r\n\r\nThis is necessary so that any change done in Chrome will be also done in the file system.\r\n\r\n![Step 7](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_7.png)\r\n\r\n# Step 8 - Map to File System Resource\r\n\r\nThis step will map the files from the Chrome workspace to the files on the disk. A change made in Chrome will be visibile in the file and a change made on a file, e.g. with a text editor, will be reflected in Chrome.\r\n\r\n*    **Open the directory structure under file://** \r\n*    Select FixtureFinder.html\r\n*    Right click, select \"Map to File System Resource\"\r\n\r\nIf you see \"Map to Network Resource\" instead, you have probably not opened the FixtureFinder.html under file:// but the one from the EmbeddedTester folder. Please look at the screenshot:\r\n\r\n![Step 8](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_8.png)\r\n\r\n# Step 9 - Select the FixtureFinder.html file from the folder where you saved it\r\n\r\n![Step 9](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_9.png)\r\n\r\n# Step 10 - Restart Dev Tools by clicking “OK”\r\n\r\n![Step 10](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_10.png)\r\n\r\nIf you mapped the files correctly the file:// entry under Sources should be gone now. Any change you make in a text editor should be reflected in Chrome and any change in Chrome should be reflected on the file system.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
