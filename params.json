A change made in Chrome will be visibile in the file and a change made on a file, e.g. with a text editor, will be reflected in Chrome.\r\n\r\n*    Select FixtureFinder.html from the folder that you added to the workspace\r\n*    Right click, select \"Map to Network Resource...\"\r\n\r\n![Step 8](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_8.png)\r\n\r\n# Step 9 - Select the FixtureFinder.html file from the list\r\n\r\n![Step 9](./images/Setup_Chrome_Dev_Tools_9.png)\r\n\r\nIf you mapped the files correctly the file:// entry under Sources should be gone now. Any change you make in a text editor should be reflected in Chrome and any change in Chrome should be reflected on the file system.\r\n",
